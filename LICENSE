  If you place this code on a publicly facing server we are going to request you [DONATE](#!PLEASE) a respectable amount so we can continue to provide this service to the community.  We will address this latter on once we have established more of a tangible product.
  
  This liscense will grant you access to immediate updates, fixes and things that the community will not get until get until after we released them.  By letting us know you plan to use this more than recreationally it gives us a means to connect with you the customer and provide better quality service, while being able to provide better usage statistics.
  
  
  This Licensing system will work by providing some details to jcsc.biz, and we will send you a license key which you can put on your server, and will keep the world a safe and orderly place!!
  
  
  SOFTWARE IS NOT FREE, But I do want to help provide some extreamly low cost alternitives.
  
  
  If you do not put this code on a server, or port forward this code or have traffic to this code other than those you personally present it to, you are free to use!!!!!  But If you are a developer trying to leverage my handy work to wow your clients, please tell them software is not FREE, purchase a license and let us know that you enjoy [BPHT5 &copy](BPHT5.com).
